The project, "Obesity Level Estimation from Lifestyle and Health Data Using Machine Learning," investigates the relationship between predictive models, data science, and healthcare. In order to forecast obesity levels based on a variety of lifestyle and health characteristics, machine learning was developed. In order to begin the project, a brief overview of obesity and its multifaceted impact on public health was presented. Given the intricacy of obesity, a large dataset comprising demographic characteristics, medical issues, and lifestyle factors was analysed using machine learning. The 2017 Patient Characteristics Survey provided a dataset that was heavily utilised in this project. A rich tapestry of information is provided by this dataset, which ranges from demographics to health conditions to insurance coverage. With 187,192 entries and 67 attributes, the massive amount of data presented both numerous opportunities and difficulties.
